Under CAT the memory required by ExaML for storing CLVs and tip vectors will be
151588800 bytes
148035 kiloBytes
144 MegaBytes
0 GigaBytes


Under GAMMA the memory required by ExaML for storing CLVs and tip vectors will be
592574400 bytes
578685 kiloBytes
565 MegaBytes
0 GigaBytes

Please note that, these are just the memory requirements for doing likelihood calculations!
To be on the safe side, we recommend that you execute ExaML on a system with twice that memory.
